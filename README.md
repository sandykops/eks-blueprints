# Amazon EKS Blueprints

Welcome to Amazon EKS Blueprints

This repository contains a collection of Terraform modules that aim to make it easier and faster for customers to adopt [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/). It can be used by AWS customers, partners, and internal AWS teams to configure and manage complete EKS clusters that are fully bootstrapped with the operational software that is needed to deploy and operate workloads.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with EKS Blueprints is to follow our [Getting Started guide](https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/latest/getting-started/).

## Motivation

Kubernetes is a powerful and extensible container orchestration technology that allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. The extensible nature of Kubernetes also allows you to use a wide range of popular open-source tools, commonly referred to as add-ons, in Kubernetes clusters. With such a large number of tooling and design choices available however, building a tailored EKS cluster that meets your applicationâ€™s specific needs can take a significant amount of time. It involves integrating a wide range of open-source tools and AWS services and requires deep expertise in AWS and Kubernetes.

AWS customers have asked for examples that demonstrate how to integrate the landscape of Kubernetes tools and make it easy for them to provision complete, opinionated EKS clusters that meet specific application requirements. Customers can use EKS Blueprints to configure and deploy purpose built EKS clusters, and start onboarding workloads in days, rather than months.
